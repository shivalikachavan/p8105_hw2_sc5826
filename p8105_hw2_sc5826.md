## Problem 1

Cleaning `pols_month.csv`

``` r
pols_month = read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate("mon", into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `1` = "January",
        `2` = "February",
        `3` = "March",
        `4` = "April",
        `5` = "May",
        `6` = "June",
        `7` = "July",
        `8` = "August",
        `9` = "September",
        `10` = "October",
        `11` = "November",
        `12` = "December"
        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order), 
    president = 
      recode(
        prez_dem, # using prez_dem to create president since grez_gop has erroneous values of 2
        `0` = "gop",
        `1` = "dem"
      )
  ) |> 
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop) |> # removing day, prez_dem, and prez_gop
  arrange(year, month) |> #arranging by year and month
  relocate(year, month, everything()) # moving year and month to front
```

Cleaning `snp.csv`. The `year` column is either `> 15` or `< 50`. I’m
making the assumption that all the years `> 15` are in the 20th century
(adding 1900) and all the years `< 50` are in the 21st century (adding
2000). Doing this makes the year column consistent across the
`pols_month` and `snp` data frames.

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate("date", into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `1` = "January",
        `2` = "February",
        `3` = "March",
        `4` = "April",
        `5` = "May",
        `6` = "June",
        `7` = "July",
        `8` = "August",
        `9` = "September",
        `10` = "October",
        `11` = "November",
        `12` = "December"
        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order),
    year = 
      case_when(
        year > 15 ~ year + 1900,
        .default = year + 2000
      )
  ) |> 
  select(-day) |> # removing day
  arrange(year, month) |> #arranging by year and month
  relocate(year, month, everything()) # moving year and month to front
```

Cleaning `unemployment.csv`.

``` r
unemployment = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_pct"
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `jan` = "January",
        `feb` = "February",
        `mar` = "March",

        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order),
  ) |> 
  arrange(year, month) |> #arranging by year and month
  relocate(year, month, everything()) # moving year and month to front
```

First merging `snp` into `pols_month`, then `unemployment` into the
result using left_joins. This keeps all the observations in
`pols_month`, since it includes some months and years during which there
is no data recorded in `snp` or `unemployment.`

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment_df = left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month")) |> 
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The cleaned `pols_month` data set has 822 observations and 9 variables
(year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem,
president), ranging from 1947 to 2015. The cleaned `snp` data set has
787 observations and 3 variables (year, month, close), ranging from 1950
to 2015. The cleaned `unemployment` data set has 816 observations and 3
variables (year, month, unemployment_pct), ranging from 1948 to 2015.

The resulting data set, `pols_snp_unemployment_df`, has 822 observations
and 11 variables (year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem,
sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, unemployment_pct), ranging from 1947
to 2015. This data set contains information about the \# of GOP and
Democrat governors, senators, representatives (congresspeople), the
political party of the president, the closing value of the S&P stock
index, and unemployment percentage for each month from 1947 to 2015.
Some data about the S&P stock index closing and unemployment percentage
was not collected for older months, and is marked as `NA` in these
cases.

## Problem 2

Reading and cleaning the `Mr. Trash Wheel` data set. Since the given
month is not a factor, I’m using the same recoding pipeline as Problem
1, using `date` as the ground truth and getting rid of the original
month and year variables. I’m also excluding the last row (row 655 in
the original Excel sheet), which contains the sum of each column. These
values can always be recalculated using the R data frame.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_data = 
  read_excel("./data/202409_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N653") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(-month, -year) |> 
  separate("date", into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `1` = "January",
        `2` = "February",
        `3` = "March",
        `4` = "April",
        `5` = "May",
        `6` = "June",
        `7` = "July",
        `8` = "August",
        `9` = "September",
        `10` = "October",
        `11` = "November",
        `12` = "December"
        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order),
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)),
    trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel"
  )|> 
  relocate(glass_bottles, sports_balls, .after = "trash_wheel")
```

Reading and cleaning the `Professor Trash Wheel` data set. Same
justifications for getting rid of original month and year columns and
row 123 which has sums.

``` r
prof_trash_wheel_data = 
  read_excel("./data/202409_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M120") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(-month, -year) |> 
  separate("date", into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `1` = "January",
        `2` = "February",
        `3` = "March",
        `4` = "April",
        `5` = "May",
        `6` = "June",
        `7` = "July",
        `8` = "August",
        `9` = "September",
        `10` = "October",
        `11` = "November",
        `12` = "December"
        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order),
    trash_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel"
  ) |> 
  relocate(glass_bottles, .after = "trash_wheel")
```

Reading and cleaning the `Gwynnda Trash Wheel` data set. Same
justifications for getting rid of original month and year columns and
row 266 which has sums.

``` r
gwynnda_trash_wheel_data = 
  read_excel("./data/202409_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L265") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(-month, -year) |> 
  separate("date", into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `1` = "January",
        `2` = "February",
        `3` = "March",
        `4` = "April",
        `5` = "May",
        `6` = "June",
        `7` = "July",
        `8` = "August",
        `9` = "September",
        `10` = "October",
        `11` = "November",
        `12` = "December"
        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order),
    trash_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel"
  )
```

Combining the data sets, moving the dates and `trash_wheel` name to the
front of the resulting data set, arranging all observations
chronological order and `trash_wheel` name.

``` r
trash_wheel_data = bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_data, prof_trash_wheel_data, gwynnda_trash_wheel_data) |> 
  relocate(year, month, day, trash_wheel) |> 
  arrange(year, month, day, trash_wheel)
```

In `mr_trash_wheel_data`, there are 651 observations and 651 unique
dumpsters. In `prof_trash_wheel_data`, there are 118 observations and
118 unique dumpsters. In `gwynnda_trash_wheel_data`, there are 263
observations and only 262 unique dumpsters. This is unlike the other 2
datasets, which have 1 observation for each dumpster. Looking closer at
`gwynnda_trash_wheel_data`, dumpster 21 has 2 observations.

The combined data set `trash_wheel_data` has 1032 observations and 15
variables. Each unique observation is noted by the date (`year`,
`month`, and `day`), the name of the `trash_wheel` (Mr. Trash Wheel,
Professor Trash Wheel, Gwynnda Trash Wheel), and the `dumpster` number.
Some observations have missing data for the remaining variables
(e.g. `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`, `cigarette_butts`,
`plastic_bags`, `wrappers`, `homes_powered`, `glass_bottles`,
`sports_balls`). Professor Trash Wheel collected 246.74 tons of trash in
total. The original excel data omits the last 2 rows in the calculated
sum of 241.26, which is why the sums are different. In June of 2022,
Gwynnda collected 18120 cigarette butts.
