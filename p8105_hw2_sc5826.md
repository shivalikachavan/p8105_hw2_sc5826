## Problem 1

Cleaning `pols_month.csv`

``` r
pols_month = read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate("mon", into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `1` = "January",
        `2` = "February",
        `3` = "March",
        `4` = "April",
        `5` = "May",
        `6` = "June",
        `7` = "July",
        `8` = "August",
        `9` = "September",
        `10` = "October",
        `11` = "November",
        `12` = "December"
        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order), 
    president = 
      recode(
        prez_dem, # using prez_dem to create president since grez_gop has erroneous values of 2
        `0` = "gop",
        `1` = "dem"
      )
  ) |> 
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop) |> # removing day, prez_dem, and prez_gop
  arrange(year, month) |> #arranging by year and month
  relocate(year, month, everything()) # moving year and month to front
```

Cleaning `snp.csv`. The `year` column is either `> 15` or `< 50`. I’m
making the assumption that all the years `> 15` are in the 20th century
(adding 1900) and all the years `< 50` are in the 21st century (adding
2000). Doing this makes the year column consistent across the
`pols_month` and `snp` data frames.

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate("date", into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `1` = "January",
        `2` = "February",
        `3` = "March",
        `4` = "April",
        `5` = "May",
        `6` = "June",
        `7` = "July",
        `8` = "August",
        `9` = "September",
        `10` = "October",
        `11` = "November",
        `12` = "December"
        ),
    month = factor(month, levels = month_order),
    year = 
      case_when(
        year > 15 ~ year + 1900,
        .default = year + 2000
      )
  ) |> 
  select(-day) |> # removing day
  arrange(year, month) |> #arranging by year and month
  relocate(year, month, everything()) # moving year and month to front
```

Cleaning `unemployment.csv`.

``` r
unemployment = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_pct"
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    month =
      recode(
        month,
        `jan` = "January",
        `feb` = "February",
        `mar` = "March",
        `apr` = "April",

    month = factor(month, levels = month_order),
  ) |> 
  arrange(year, month) |> #arranging by year and month
  relocate(year, month, everything()) # moving year and month to front
```

First merging `snp` into `pols_month`, then `unemployment` into the
result using left_joins. This keeps all the observations in
`pols_month`, since it includes some months and years during which there
is no data recorded in `snp` or `unemployment.`

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment_df = left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month")) |> 
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The cleaned `pols_month` data set has 822 observations and 9 variables
(year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem,
president), ranging from 1947 to 2015. The cleaned `snp` data set has
787 observations and 3 variables (year, month, close), ranging from 1950
to 2015. The cleaned `unemployment` data set has 816 observations and 3
variables (year, month, unemployment_pct), ranging from 1948 to 2015.

The resulting data set, `pols_snp_unemployment_df`, has 822 observations
and 11 variables (year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem,
sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, unemployment_pct), ranging from 1947
to 2015. This data set contains information about the \# of GOP and
Democrat governors, senators, representatives (congresspeople), the
political party of the president, the closing value of the S&P stock
index, and unemployment percentage for each month from 1947 to 2015.
Some data about the S&P stock index closing an unemployment percentage
was not collected for older months, and is marked as `NA` in these
cases.
